	"details": "## Overview\n\nOpenFGA v1.5.7 and v1.5.8 are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from` expressions and a userset. \n\n## Fix\n\n- If you are using OpenFGA within Docker or as a Go library, as a binary, or through Docker, downgrade to v1.5.6 as soon as possible. \n- If using Helm chart, upgrade to 0.2.11 as soon as possible. \n\nThis fix is backward compatible, except if you wrote your own custom storage adapter (due to reverting the breaking changes in 1.5.7).\n",
